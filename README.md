<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

Server-side mod that makes loot more renewable for multiplayer servers.
Opening a chest/barrel or any loot container will save the loottable that is beeing used to generate the items.
When a new players opens that chest and a configurable amount of time has passed, the chest loot regenerates.
This also means, that loot containers cannot be broken and cannot have their items extracted from using hoppers.
